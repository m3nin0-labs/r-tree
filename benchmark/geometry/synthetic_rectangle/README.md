## Geometries - Synthetic data

This directory stores the tool created to transform the synthetic data consumed in the test batteries. The raw data is available in the [tree.jnlp.spec](tree.jnlp.spec) file and was generated with the [R-Tree Applet](http://gis.umb.no/gis/applets/rtree2/jdk1.1/).

### Usage

To generate these data, simply run the [autortree.py](autortree.py) script with a Python >= 3.6 interpreter.

```shell
python autortree.py
```
