## Benchmark - Geometries

The benchmark tests use different sources of geometries. This directory centralizes all the tools necessary for manipulating, visualizing, and generating these data.

The following datasets were used:

- [Brazil federation units](shapefile);
- [Set of synthetic rectangles](synthetic_rectangle);
- [Utility to visualize the geometries data](geom.py).

> It is worth noting that running these utilities is not mandatory for executing the benchmarks, as these utilities were created to facilitate the generation and configuration of the tests, which are already available in the [tests](../tests) directory.
